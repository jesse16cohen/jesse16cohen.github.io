<p><B>Ice Hockey</B><p>

<P>My favorite sport to play, watch, talk about is by far hockey. Ive been playing hockey since i was five years old, my dad got me started because he has played hockey all his life. Throughout the years hockey has become a huge part of my life, i cant imagine my life without hockey.<P>

<P>Ever since i started watching hockey i have been a Capitals fan. Im from NJ, and my dad is a NJ Devils fan. So im not really sure how i became a Capitals fan. My favorite player is Nicklas Backstrom number 19, he is a fun player to watch.<P>
